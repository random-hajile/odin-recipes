Project #1 - "Recipes"
(7/2/2024)

This project will be my first while learning to
code with the Odin Project.

All of their previous lessons have provided step-
by-step instructions, but now I must show case
what skills I've acquired without any hand-holding.

Here I will create a rudimentary web page for the
purpose of: (1) practicing my ability to work on
projects in a GitHub repository, and (2) putting
my HTML knowledge to use.

I haven't learned anything about CSS yet.

I am fairly confidnent in my ability to create
content using HTML, but I am afraid of commitment.

That is, committing project updates to GitHub.

I'm not sure I completely remember how to do that.
